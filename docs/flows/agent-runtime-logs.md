# Agent runtime logs flow

## Overview

An authorized reader requests Pod status or one page of container output for an
admitted Agent revision. OpenClaw Control Plane (OCC) authorizes the exact target,
asks the selected Compute Driver for raw Kubernetes data, and returns only
classified, redacted, bounded records. OCC does not persist logs; downloads
stay on the reader's device.

## Entry Points

- Trigger: `GET /namespaces/:namespaceId/agents/:agentId/deployments/:deploymentId/runtime`
  and `GET .../runtime/logs` (optionally `download=true`) from the console Logs
  tab, `occ agent runtime|logs` (`internal/occcli/agent_runtime.go`) or the API.
  Without `--revision`, the CLI uses a newer revision with Pods when available,
  otherwise the active revision, otherwise the latest revision
  (`agentRevision`, `latestRevisionID`).
- Source: `apps/controller/src/index.ts:createFastifyApp`,
  `packages/occ/src/index.ts:OpenClawController.describeAgentRuntime` and
  `readAgentRuntimeLogs`, `packages/occ/src/runtime-logs/`, and
  `apps/controller/src/drivers/compute/kubernetes/index.ts:KubernetesComputeDriver.describeAgentRuntime`
  and `readAgentRuntimeLogs`.
- Assumptions: `deploymentId` is an admitted AgentRevision ID. Status needs exact
  Agent `operate` and `read` plus AgentRevision `read`; log text needs Agent
  `read_logs` or `administer` instead of `operate`, and no AgentRevision grant
  (`OpenClawController.authorizeRuntimeLogRead` tries `read_logs` first and
  falls back to `administer` unless a Restriction denied `read_logs`). The
  revision must still belong to the exact Agent, so an Agent grant covers every
  revision that Agent deploys.

## Execution Trace

### 1. Admit and authorize

`packages/contracts/src/api/routes.ts:occApiRoutes` declares both GET routes with
a closed query schema. `apps/controller/src/index.ts:perform` answers `501` when
`agentRuntimeLogs` is disabled. `OpenClawController.runtimeLogTarget` authorizes
the tier action and Agent `read` (plus revision `read` for status only), resolves
the revision within the exact Agent, then rejects a Driver without
`describeAgentRuntime` or with `runtimeLogging: "driver"`. Only then does the
route's `admitRead` callback apply the replica-local
`apps/controller/src/http/runtime-logs.ts:RuntimeLogLimiter` around the Driver
reads, so a denial is always audited and never spends a token.

### 2. Describe the runtime

`KubernetesComputeDriver.describeAgentRuntime` reports the current termination
when a container is terminated, otherwise its prior termination. It resolves the owned Namespace, then
lists Pods by the exact Agent, revision and workload-role labels: dedicated
Gateways and Harnesses in the shared tenant namespace in a single cluster. The
two-cluster profile reads dedicated Gateways in its control target and Harnesses
in its execution target. It lists Events by
`involvedObject.uid`, keeps only that Pod's Events, drops the scheduler's
`FailedScheduling` retry after a lost PVC update race once the Pod has a node,
caps them at 100 and takes each
Event's `container` from `involvedObject.fieldPath` (`spec.containers{name}` or
the init or ephemeral form; `null` for Pod-level Events such as `Scheduled`). A log
read passes `{ source, events: false }`, so it lists only that source's Pods and
no Events. Each
Kubernetes call has a five-second deadline; a `403` becomes
`RuntimeLogsForbiddenByClusterError`. `runtime-logs/description.ts:validRuntimeDescription`
checks names, UIDs and counts, masks node, image and Secret names in Event
messages (`runtime-logs/redact.ts:maskRuntimeEventText`) and redacts reasons and
Event messages.

### 3. Read one page

`runtime-logs/read.ts:readRuntimeLogPage` verifies the HMAC cursor
(`runtime-logs/cursor.ts`) against the principal, Agent, revision and source,
and accepts only a Pod the description listed. A request without a cursor, or
with one older than an hour, or a cursor whose Pod is gone, starts a view: the controller appends
`openclaw.agents.runtime_logs.view`, an `access` audit event naming the admitting
action, before any log read. The Driver re-checks
Pod ownership, calls `readNamespacedPodLog` with `tailLines`, `sinceSeconds`,
`previous`, a 1 MiB `limitBytes` and timestamps, and re-reads the Pod.
`kubernetesRuntimeLogLine` separates kubelet's RFC3339 timestamp from each raw
line and converts numeric offsets to UTC while retaining every fractional digit.
Unknown or malformed offset prefixes remain untimed raw text. A cursor
poll derives `sinceSeconds` from the cursor: from its newest delivered line, or,
when the view has delivered nothing yet, from the previous read (a full or
byte-cut tail then emits `window_exceeded`). When a resumed read delivers nothing
new on every poll because the next line does not fit in the 1 MiB limit (typically
one oversized line), and that line is more than about 3 seconds older than the read,
the cursor drops its delivered time and
continues from this read, as a view that has delivered nothing yet does. The page
emits `window_exceeded` dated at that line: it and the lines logged after
it until this read are lost. A carried PEM block then keeps no delivered frontier,
so it stays masked for the rest of the view. OCC
drops earlier lines. For the cursor time, the signed cursor carries
`frontierComplete`, `frontierCount` (lines delivered at that time) and the last
16 of their hashes. When `frontierComplete` is true and the read holds that
time's first line (it starts earlier, or the Driver page is shorter than the tail
and not byte-cut) with its timed lines in order through that time, OCC skips the
first `frontierCount` lines at that time, if the hashes match the end of that run,
and delivers the rest: a group larger than 16 lines neither replays nor hides
later lines. Otherwise it consumes one remembered hash per delivered occurrence,
and lines it then delivers at that time drop the count. Text with no remembered hash is new
only while the hashes cover the whole count; identical text beyond its count also
needs `frontierComplete`. A new frontier is complete when its consumed prefix is
ordered and starts after the earliest fetched timestamp, or the Driver page is
shorter than the requested tail and not byte-cut. The bit persists while the
frontier timestamp stays the same. Otherwise matching-time text stays suppressed
until the timestamp advances: expanding a previously cut tail must not make an
older occurrence appear new. A legacy cursor without `frontierCount` has a count
only when it holds fewer than 16 hashes. A page byte cut keeps the count, so
undelivered lines at a complete frontier resume. It emits `stream_replaced`,
`window_exceeded`, `cursor_expired` or `truncated` gaps, and passes the rest to
`runtime-logs/sanitize.ts:sanitizeRuntimeLogChunk`, the only producer of
`SanitizedRuntimeLogRecord`. `page-budget.ts` measures serialized pages,
signed cursors and the HTTP envelope against 512 KiB. Full candidates precede
bounded prefix builds reuse admission and clocks without I/O or audits. Fit is
checked; maximum filling is not promised. Fetched masking/withholding survive prefix builds; persistent state advances only
through delivered rows. Sources share the budget.

For container follow polls, the signed cursor also carries optional `pemOpen`
and `pemAfterTime` state. It describes the delivered boundary, not the start of
the fetched overlap. The reader validates timestamp order in the consumed prefix
through the last delivered line, without replaying older content through that
state. Each delivered line is compared with the reliable `pemAfterTime` from the
prior cursor, not with an earlier line on the same page. Only a line strictly
newer than that prior frontier can close a carried open block. Thus an ordered
same-page BEGIN and END at the same newer timestamp can close it. Times at or
before the prior frontier and evicted line hashes do not establish forward
progress; replayed overlap cannot erase a carried later BEGIN. Ordinary non-PEM
text remains visible while ambiguous context stays open.

Missing, invalid or reordered times make the frontier uncertain (`null`); later
timestamped pages alone cannot repair that uncertainty. Empty polls preserve it,
and lines beyond the page or byte cut do not advance it. A new view, expiry,
instance/Pod change or replacement during the read discards the old context.
The paired fields are validated together under the existing cursor MAC; malformed
or inconsistent pairs fail as `cursor_invalid` before a Driver read. Legacy
cursors and initial tails without observed PEM boundaries remain unknown and
best-effort.

`source=sandbox` skips the Compute description. `OpenClawController.readSandboxLogs`
lists the source only when the selected Sandbox Driver provisioned the revision
and implements `readSandboxLogs`, resolves Compute's placement with
`resolveSandboxNamespace`, and runs `runtime-logs/sandbox.ts:readSandboxLogPage`.
`OpenShellSandboxDriver.readSandboxLogs` derives the Sandbox name from the
revision and calls `GetSandboxLogs` through `openShellSandboxLogReader`, which
exposes nothing else. OpenShell stamps supervisor lines when recorded but
batches them, and filters `since_time` by that stamp, so a resume sends a time
`SANDBOX_LOG_OVERLAP_MS` (5 s) behind the newest delivered line; the cursor
keeps one hash per line delivered since then (up to 48), and each re-read line
consumes one. First pages retain the requested window start.
Both readers checkpoint serialized cuts with an authenticated window digest,
raw-prefix count, query floor and pre-cut baseline. Known container times retain
the captured floor before digesting; empty checkpoints persist. Stable windows drain
before overlap advances, including untimed lines and over-capacity timestamp
groups. Changed values, tails or clipped windows emit gaps before fresh snapshots;
UID/restarts reset container progress,
and PEM recovery clears inconsistent time boundaries while preserving masking. Timed windows resume overlap. Value-identical replacements remain unobservable; full checkpoints report gaps. Missing remembered lines or over-capacity timestamps also emit
gaps. gRPC `NOT_FOUND` (absent
Sandbox, or concealed from a non-member) maps to
`RUNTIME_LOGS_SANDBOX_NOT_FOUND`, never to an empty page. Lines naming two
Sandbox IDs are refused; a new Sandbox ID emits `stream_replaced`.
`sanitizeSandboxLogLines` parses the OCSF shorthand into allowlisted fields.

A download (`download=true`) forces `tailLines` to 1000, rejects a `cursor` with
`400`, and always starts a new view; `apps/controller/src/index.ts:auditAction`
names its audit event, and any denial, `openclaw.agents.runtime_logs.download`.

### 4. Return

`apps/controller/src/http/runtime-logs.ts:runtimeLogPageBody` accepts only
sanitized records and fails on the reserved `content` class.
`runtimeLogDownloadBody` serializes the same branded records as text lines with
the same check, and `runtimeLogDownloadFileName` names the attachment
`<agent>-<revision>-<source>-<pod>.log`. A `minLevel` query
(`runtime-logs/read.ts:runtimeLogPageAtLevel`) removes sanitized lines below that
level after the cursor is signed, so polls resume after hidden lines; unknown-level
lines, gaps and withheld counts stay. The console asks for `minLevel=info` unless
**Include debug** is selected; its level chips and text filter
(`apps/controller/src/console/agents/logs.mjs`) run only over loaded rows. The
console remembers a `403` from either route for the signed-in operator for the
page session, so reopening the Logs tab adds no audited denial, and another
operator signing in on the tab asks again. Its status message names the
log-text grants too. On the Gateway source it points to the Harness source while
no Harness Pod is ready, or to Deployment activity while none exists. The
CLI's `--follow` loop re-sends the cursor every 2 seconds.
`internal/occcli/agent_runtime.go:runAgentLogs` treats command-context cancellation as a
clean follow exit during both initial revision selection and page polling.
Without `--follow`, a canceled request remains an error. Driver errors map to
fixed `RUNTIME_LOGS_*` codes; the whole request has a ten-second deadline.

## Debugging and Verification

- `go test ./internal/occcli -run '^TestResourceRequestStopsWhenCommandContextIsCanceled$'`
  exercises the real CLI and HTTP client against a loopback server, canceling
  in-flight Agent and revision lookups. Follow exits successfully; one-shot reads
  retain cancellation errors. This proves local CLI cancellation, not deployed OCC.

- `503 RUNTIME_LOGS_CLUSTER_RBAC` means the API ServiceAccount lacks
  `pods/log`, `events` or, on an execution cluster, `pods` reads in that
  namespace. `503 RUNTIME_LOGS_AUDIT_UNAVAILABLE` means no output was read.
- `runtime-logs-content.test.mjs` exercises handler credentials, prompts and
  protocol lines plus synthetic Driver pages for masking, replay/eviction,
  uncertain times, cuts, paired-field validation, resets and serialized cursors.
  `occ-api-security.test.mjs` covers tiers, cursors and failures;
  `kubernetes-compute.test.mjs` covers plane selection, Event filtering and typed
  `403` using in-memory Kubernetes responses. `agent-runtime-logs-k3d-real.test.mjs`
  reads a real cluster. `runtime-logs-sandbox.test.mjs` uses the real handler and
  Driver with a log-only gateway client; `openshell-gateway-wire.test.mjs` checks
  the wire shape. Synthetic responses do not establish real-cluster behavior.
