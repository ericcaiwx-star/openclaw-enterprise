# Share an existing Agent in the console

Installation administrators can share one Agent with a person who already has an
account. Follow the [sharing procedure](../../guides/console/agent-sharing.md);
this page defines the grants, limits, and uncertain outcomes. See the
[console reference](../console.md) for the rest of Agent detail.

## Grants

Installation administrators share an Agent using an existing person's Principal ID.
The console reuses or creates Namespace-scoped Roles for `namespace:read` and,
separately, `agent:read` plus `agent:administer`, bound to the exact Namespace and
Agent. Role reuse requires matching scope and permissions, regardless of name.
Namespace read enables discovery without granting child access. The console
accepts only a `prn_` Principal ID and rejects an email address before any
request; the API validates subjects and targets, and an unknown Principal ID is
reported as such. Sharing does not provision or search for accounts.

The acknowledgment covers full native administration of the shared Agent,
including its conversations, settings, tools and accessible credentials. This is
not restricted chat or automatic personal identity for each chat. Sharing does
not grant OCE Configuration, deployment, Secret or Agent stop permissions. The
[native launcher](../agent-native-admin.md) still requires its Installation setup and a supported runtime.

## Direct grants and removal

**Direct Agent grants** lists explicit bindings to this Agent and their Role
permissions. It is not an effective-access report. **Remove binding** deletes
only that binding and preserves Namespace discovery. Other grants, groups and
Installation administration can still provide access; accounts, Roles and
Agents are retained.

## Failures and uncertain outcomes

Policy mutations run sequentially. Confirmed steps remain visible after a later
failure. After an uncertain response, **Refresh sharing** reads current Roles
and bindings before another change is allowed; writes never retry automatically.
A matching binding proves present configuration, not the outcome of an earlier
request. The console omits the sharing panel for people who are not Installation
administrators, so it never reads (and the API never audits a denial of) sharing
policy for them; Agent detail, native admission and stop retain their own
authorization checks. An expired session
clears the private view as usual.
